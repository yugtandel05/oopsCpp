// Constructor --> Special method invoked automatically at time of object creation. Used for Initialisation.
/*
- Same name as class
- Constructor doesn't have a return type
- Only called once (automatically), at object creation
- Memory allocation happens when constructor is called
*/
//NOTE--> Always declare a constructor Public
//NOTE --> We can create multiple constructor in a single class but they should not have same parameters. This phenomena called CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING. This is an example of polymorphism

/*
